        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For a great tasting beef dish from Asia, fire meat is delicious and easy to prepare.<br>
            Ice cold beer is the beverage recommended with fire meat.</p>
        
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Â½ cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>1 large red onion, chopped</li>
                <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
                <li>2 leeks, chopped</li>
                <li>1 small carrot, chopped</li>
                <li>1 pound beef round steak, sliced paper thin</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, garlic,<br>
                    and red onion. Stir in the black pepper, red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, leeks <br>
                    and carrot. Mix in the meat by hand to ensure even coating. Cover and let marinate <br>
                    for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>Brush the bottom half of a wok with cooking oil, and heat over medium-high heat. <br>
                    Put in all of the meat and marinade at once, and cook stirring constantly. The <br>
                    meat will be cooked after just a few minutes. Remove from heat and serve with rice <br>
                    or noodles. For Korean-style fire meat, roll the meat mixture up in a leaf of red lettuce.</li>
